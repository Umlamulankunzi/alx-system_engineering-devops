# Project Title: 0x15 API

## Description
This project focuses on accessing employee data through an API and organizing and exporting it to different data structures. The goal is to demonstrate the use of Python scripting to accomplish this task, highlighting the advantages of using a programming language like Python over Bash scripting.

## Background
Traditionally, system administrators relied heavily on Bash scripting for their automation tasks. While Bash is suitable for many purposes, it can become messy and inefficient when dealing with more complex scenarios. The new generation of system administrators, known as SREs (Site Reliability Engineers), have expanded their skill set to include programming languages beyond Bash.

One popular method for exposing applications and datasets is through APIs. APIs serve as the public-facing components of websites and microservices, enabling external parties to interact with and manipulate data. In this project, I will leverage an API to access employee data and perform various operations on it.

## Technologies Used
- Python
1. CSV
1. Json
1. Requests
- API
- Scripting
- Back-end

## Project Goals
- Access employee data through an API
- Organize employee data using Python scripts
- Export employee data to different data structures
- Showcase the advantages of Python scripting over Bash scripting for this particular task

By completing this project, I aim to demonstrate the power and flexibility of Python in handling API data and highlight its superiority in comparison to Bash scripting for tasks of this nature.
