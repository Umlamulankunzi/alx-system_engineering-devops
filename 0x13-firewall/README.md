# 0x13. Firewall

This project is part of the DevOps, SysAdmin, and Security curriculum at Holberton School. It is focused on web stack debugging and specifically deals with the concept of firewalls.

## Background Context

I was working with servers that did not have a firewall configured, *in this Project, I will be configuring a ufw firewall for the servers*. A firewall is a security measure that controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined rules. It acts as a barrier between a trusted internal network and an untrusted external network, helping to protect the system from unauthorized access and potential threats.
